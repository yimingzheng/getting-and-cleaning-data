# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a course project for the Coursera course of "Getting And Cleaning Data". The run_analysis.R script cleans the [Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0) ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).    

The script performs 6 tasks as described in the [project handout](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-034/human_grading/view/courses/975118/assessments/3/submissions)
>1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
>2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.    
>3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.      
>4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
>5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
